					Image Source and Usage License
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
	The images were acquired by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) with airborne acquisition flights over several cities in Germany
	and several European countries. The data collection was carried out with a helicopter or aircraft, Germany using a low-cost camera
	array system consisting of three DSLR cameras mounted on a flexible platform for recording the data. Only the nadir-looking images
	 were selected. In total, 16 non-overlapping RGB images of size 5616x3744 pixels were chosen. The flight altitude of about 1000m above
	 ground led to a GSD of approximately 13cm/pixel. The images represent urban and partly rural areas with highways, first/second order roads,
	 and complex traffic situations, such as crossings and congestion.

				Before downloading the dataset, please verify that you understand and will abide the license agreement associated with this dataset.
				The license is as followed.  Please read it carefully.

        While you should read the actual license in full, here are a few important points I want to emphasize:

        This dataset may ONLY be used for non-commercial uses
        This means that it cannot be used to train models for commercial use
        You may NOT redistribute the dataset
        This includes posting it on a website or sending it to others
        You may include images from this dataset in academic papers
        These restrictions include not just the images in their current form but any images created from these images (i.e. “derivative” images)
        We will be sending the foreground images, alpha mattes, and the code to then composite them onto new backgrounds.  These makes the dataset more flexible plus it will be a much smaller download.  However, this restriction means that after you composite our foregrounds onto new background images, those are considered “derivative” works and are still covered by our license, meaning you cannot use them for commercial use or redistribute them.
        Models trained using our data may only be distributed (posted on the internet or given to others) under the condition that the model can only be used for non-commercial uses
        The dataset and code are provided “as is” with no warranty
        Any publications utilizing this dataset should reference our paper

				<p style="text-align:justify;">
				      All images and their associated annotations in SkyScapes <strong style="color:blue">can be used for academic purposes only which means any commercial use is prohibited without prior written permission from DLR.</strong>.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Object Category
				</h2>
				<p>
						The semantic annotation in SkyScapes-v1.0 include thirty-one categories: low veg-etation, paved road, non-paved road, paved parking place,non-paved parking place,
						bike-way, sidewalk, entrance/exit,danger area, building, car, trailer, van, truck, large truck,bus, clutter, impervious surface, tree, and 12 lane-markingtypes.
						The considered lane-markings are the following:dash-line, long-line, small dash-line, turn sign, plus sign,other signs, crosswalk, stop-line, zebra zone,
						no parkingzone, parking zone, other lane-markings. The selection ofclasses was influenced by their relevance to real-world ap-plications, hence, road-like objects dominate. .
				</p>

				<h2>
					Annotation format
				</h2>
						<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 17px">
					In the dataset, the images have been annotated with polygons. In the SkyScapes-v1.0, the annotations in the format of images are provided.
					In the future, the annotations in the format of JSON will be added.
				</p>
						<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 17px">
						How to read the annotation is as follows:


						SkyScapes-Dense class name, Grayscale pixel value, 	RGB pixel value


						SkyScapes-Lane class name, 	Grayscale pixel value,	RGB pixel value

						Background – black,	0,	0	0	0
						Dash Line – between lanes,	1,	255	0	0
						Long Line – white/yellow,	2,	0	0	255
						Small dash line – in entrances, crossroads, and so on,	3,	255	255	0
						Turn signs,	4,	0	255	0
						Other signs: speed limits, bus, taxi, the disabled, bike and so on,	5,	255	128	0
						Plus sign in the crossroads,	6,	128	0	0
						Crosswalk,	7,	0	255	255
						Stop line,	8,	0	128	0
						Zebra zone,	9,	255	0	255
						No parking zone,	10,	0	150	150
						Parking space, 11,	200	200	0
						The rest of lane-markings,	12,	100	0	200
